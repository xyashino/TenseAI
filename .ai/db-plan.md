---

## 3. Relationships Between Tables

### 3.1. `auth.users` ↔ `profiles`

- **Implementation**: `profiles.user_id` is both PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY to `auth.users(id)`

### 3.2. `profiles` ↔ `training_sessions`
- **Type**: One-to-Many
- **Relationship**: One user can have multiple training sessions
- **Implementation**: `training_sessions.user_id` → `profiles(user_id)`

### 3.3. `training_sessions` ↔ `rounds`
- **Type**: One-to-Many (specifically, 1:3)
- **Relationship**: Each training session has exactly 3 rounds
- **Implementation**: `rounds.session_id` → `training_sessions(id)`
- **Constraint**: `UNIQUE (session_id, round_number)` with `round_number` CHECK (1-3)

### 3.4. `rounds` ↔ `questions`
- **Type**: One-to-Many (specifically, 1:10)
- **Relationship**: Each round has exactly 10 questions

- **Purpose**: Provides direct access to all answers for a session without joining through rounds

### 3.7. `questions` ↔ `question_reports`
- **Type**: One-to-Many
- **Relationship**: A question can be reported multiple times by different users
- **Implementation**: `question_reports.question_id` → `questions(id)`

## 5. Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies

RLS will be enabled on all tables containing user-specific data. Users can only access their own data through policies that match `user_id` with `auth.uid()`.

### 5.1. `profiles` Table Policies

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Users can view their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile"
  ON profiles FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Policy: Users can update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
  ON profiles FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

      SELECT 1 FROM training_sessions
      WHERE training_sessions.id = rounds.session_id
      AND training_sessions.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Policy: Users can create rounds for their own sessions
CREATE POLICY "Users can create own session rounds"
  ON rounds FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM training_sessions
      WHERE training_sessions.id = rounds.session_id
      AND training_sessions.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Policy: Users can update rounds in their own sessions
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own session rounds"
  ON rounds FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM training_sessions
      WHERE training_sessions.id = rounds.session_id
      AND training_sessions.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own session questions"
  ON questions FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM rounds
      JOIN training_sessions ON training_sessions.id = rounds.session_id
      WHERE rounds.id = questions.round_id
      AND training_sessions.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Policy: Users can create questions for their own sessions
CREATE POLICY "Users can create own session questions"
  ON questions FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM rounds
      JOIN training_sessions ON training_sessions.id = rounds.session_id

      AND training_sessions.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### 5.5. `user_answers` Table Policies

-- Policy: Users can view their own answers
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own answers"
  ON user_answers FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM training_sessions
      WHERE training_sessions.id = user_answers.session_id
      AND training_sessions.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Policy: Users can create answers for their own sessions
CREATE POLICY "Users can create own answers"
  ON user_answers FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM training_sessions

-- Policy: Users can create their own reports
CREATE POLICY "Users can create own reports"
  ON question_reports FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Note: Only admins should be able to update/delete reports
-- Admin policies would be added separately with a role-based system
```

---

## 6. Database Triggers and Functions

### 6.1. Auto-create Profile on User Registration

**Purpose**: Automatically create a profile entry when a new user is registered in Supabase Auth.

```sql
-- Function to create profile
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (user_id, name, default_difficulty, onboarding_completed)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'name', ''),
    'Basic',
    FALSE
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Trigger on auth.users
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

### 6.2. Update `updated_at` Timestamp

**Purpose**: Automatically update the `updated_at` column when records are modified.

```sql
-- Generic function to update updated_at timestamp
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_updated_at()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.updated_at = NOW();
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Apply to all tables with updated_at column
CREATE TRIGGER set_updated_at_profiles
  BEFORE UPDATE ON profiles
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_updated_at();

CREATE TRIGGER set_updated_at_training_sessions
  BEFORE UPDATE ON training_sessions
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_updated_at();

CREATE TRIGGER set_updated_at_rounds
  BEFORE UPDATE ON rounds
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_updated_at();
```

---

## 7. Additional Design Notes and Considerations

### 7.1. Normalization Level
The schema follows **Third Normal Form (3NF)**, which provides a good balance between data integrity and query performance for the MVP:
- No partial dependencies (all non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key)
- No transitive dependencies (non-key attributes depend only on the primary key)
- Minimal data redundancy

### 7.2. Data Integrity Measures
1. **Foreign Key Constraints**: All relationships use `ON DELETE CASCADE` to maintain referential integrity and automatically clean up related data when a user or session is deleted.
2. **Check Constraints**: Ensure data validity (e.g., scores 0-10, round numbers 1-3, question numbers 1-10).
3. **Unique Constraints**: Prevent duplicate rounds or questions within a session/round.
4. **Not Null Constraints**: Enforce required fields at the database level.
5. **ENUM Types**: Restrict values to predefined sets for `difficulty_level`, `tense_name`, and `session_status`.

### 7.3. Performance Considerations
1. **Indexes**: Strategically placed on foreign keys and frequently queried columns.
2. **JSONB for Options**: More flexible than multiple columns and allows efficient querying if needed in the future.
3. **Composite Indexes**: `(user_id, status)` on `training_sessions` for the common "find user's active session" query.
4. **Denormalized session_id in user_answers**: Avoids complex joins when fetching all answers for a session summary.

### 7.4. Security Architecture
1. **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Primary security mechanism ensuring data isolation between users.
2. **Policy-Based Access**: Explicit policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.
3. **Secure Functions**: The `handle_new_user()` function uses `SECURITY DEFINER` to allow the trigger to insert into profiles even though it runs in the context of the auth schema.

### 7.5. Scalability Path
While designed for MVP scale, the schema supports future enhancements:
- **Question Bank**: A separate `question_bank` table could be added later without modifying the current structure.
- **Additional Tenses**: Simply add values to the `tense_name` ENUM.
- **More Difficulty Levels**: Add values to the `difficulty_level` ENUM.
- **Statistics/Analytics**: The current structure supports complex queries for user progress tracking.

### 7.6. Theory Content Management
As per requirements, theory articles will be stored as **static Markdown files** in the Astro frontend project, not in the database. The frontend will be responsible for:
- Loading and rendering Markdown files
- Mapping tense names to their respective theory files
- Providing navigation between theory articles

### 7.7. Session Resume Logic
The application logic will:
1. Query for sessions with `status = 'active'` for the current user
2. If found, determine the last completed round by checking `rounds.completed_at`
3. Resume from the appropriate point (mid-round or between rounds)
4. Update the session to `status = 'completed'` when all 3 rounds are finished

### 7.8. AI Integration Points
The schema supports AI integration at three key points:
1. **Question Generation**: Populate `questions` table with AI-generated content (question text, options, correct answer)
2. **Round Feedback**: Store brief AI feedback in `rounds.round_feedback`
3. **Final Analysis**: Store detailed, Markdown-formatted feedback in `training_sessions.final_feedback`

### 7.9. Metrics Collection
For the success metric tracking mentioned in the PRD:
- **Completed Sessions**: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM training_sessions WHERE status = 'completed'`
- **Per-User Completion**: `SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) FROM training_sessions WHERE status = 'completed' GROUP BY user_id`
- **Completion Rates**: Can be calculated by comparing active vs completed sessions

### 7.10. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)
The schema is designed to accommodate future features without major restructuring:
- **Spaced Repetition**: Could add a `review_schedule` table linking to questions
- **Gamification**: Could add `achievements` and `user_points` tables
- **Social Features**: Could add `user_connections` and `shared_results` tables
- **Advanced Statistics**: Current structure supports complex analytical queries

---

## 8. Migration Order

When implementing this schema, create database objects in the following order to respect dependencies:

1. Custom ENUM types (`difficulty_level`, `tense_name`, `session_status`)
2. `profiles` table
3. `training_sessions` table
4. `rounds` table
5. `questions` table
6. `user_answers` table
7. `question_reports` table
8. Indexes (can be created after tables or concurrently)
9. Triggers and functions (`handle_new_user`, `handle_updated_at`)
10. RLS policies (enable RLS first, then create policies)

---

## 9. Summary

This database schema provides a robust foundation for the TenseAI MVP. It balances:
- **Data Integrity**: Through constraints, foreign keys, and ENUM types
- **Security**: Via comprehensive Row-Level Security policies
- **Performance**: With strategic indexes and efficient data structures
- **Scalability**: Designed to accommodate future features without major refactoring
- **Simplicity**: Focused on MVP requirements while maintaining professional standards

The schema directly supports all functional requirements from the PRD (REQ-01 through REQ-27) and implements all decisions from the database planning session. It's ready to be translated into SQL migration files and deployed to a Supabase PostgreSQL database.
