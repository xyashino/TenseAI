# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - TenseAI
## 1. Product Overview
TenseAI is a web application designed to help English language learners master grammatical tenses. It leverages AI to provide a personalized and effective learning experience. The application generates contextual exercises and offers intelligent feedback, moving beyond static, repetitive drills.

The target audience is adult, self-directed learners who need a focused tool to practice and improve their understanding of English tenses. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on providing a core, high-quality learning loop for the four most common English tenses.

The overarching goal of the MVP is to launch a stable, functional application that validates the core concept: AI-driven practice can significantly improve grammar acquisition.

## 2. User Problem
English learners, particularly those studying on their own, often struggle with the nuances of grammar tenses. Common challenges include:
- Lack of personalized feedback: Standard exercises provide a simple right/wrong answer without explaining the underlying error.
- Repetitive and unengaging content: Textbooks and many apps use a limited set of example sentences that quickly become boring and fail to cover real-world usage.
- Difficulty tracking progress: Learners often don't know if they are genuinely improving or just memorizing answers to specific questions.

TenseAI addresses these problems by providing an interactive learning environment where users receive AI-generated, context-rich questions and intelligent feedback that helps them understand their mistakes and see a clear path to improvement.

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1. User Account Management
- `REQ-01`: Users must be able to register for an account using an email address and a password.
- `REQ-02`: Registration requires providing a name for personalization.
- `REQ-03`: The system must include an account activation process via email.
- `REQ-04`: Registered users must be able to log in to their account.
- `REQ-05`: Users must have the ability to reset a forgotten password.

### 3.2. Onboarding
- `REQ-06`: New users will complete a mandatory, two-step onboarding process after registration.
- `REQ-07`: Step one collects the user's name.
- `REQ-08`: Step two allows the user to set a default difficulty level (Basic or Advanced).

### 3.3. Core Application Interface
- `REQ-09`: The application will use responsive web navigation: a sidebar on desktop and a collapsible top navigation on small screens.
- `REQ-10`: The navigation will contain four main sections: "Practice", "Active Sessions", "Theory", and "History".

### 3.4. Theory Module
- `REQ-11`: The "Theory" section will provide access to educational materials for four tenses: Present Simple, Past Simple, Present Perfect, and Future Simple.
- `REQ-12`: All theoretical content will be created manually in Markdown format.
- `REQ-13`: Each article will have a consistent structure: usage, sentence construction, and common time expressions.

### 3.5. Training Module
- `REQ-14`: From the "Practice" screen, users can initiate a training session.
- `REQ-15`: Before starting, the user must select a grammar tense and a difficulty level (Basic: A2/B1 vocabulary, Advanced: B2 vocabulary). The difficulty level will default to the user's preference set during onboarding but can be changed for any session.
- `REQ-16`: A training session consists of 3 consecutive rounds.
- `REQ-17`: Each round contains 10 AI-generated, multiple-choice questions.
- `REQ-18`: After each round, a summary screen is displayed showing the score (e.g., 7/10) and brief, general feedback generated by the AI.
- `REQ-19`: After completing all 3 rounds, a final session summary is displayed, showing the scores for all rounds and a detailed, AI-generated explanation of all errors made during the session.
- `REQ-20`: The application must persist the state of an active session on the server. If the user closes the site or browser tab, they will be prompted to resume the session upon their next visit. A local cache may be used to improve recovery speed, but the server is the source of truth.

### 3.6. Session History
- `REQ-21`: The "History" section will display a chronological list of all completed training sessions.
- `REQ-22`: Each entry in the list will show the date, the grammar tense practiced, and the final score trend (e.g., 6/10 → 7/10 → 8/10).
- `REQ-23`: Users can click on a history entry to view the detailed final summary screen for that session, including the questions, their answers, and the AI's detailed error analysis.

### 3.7. AI Integration
- `REQ-24`: A Large Language Model (LLM) will be used to generate questions, round feedback, and the final error analysis.
- `REQ-25`: The AI's communication tone will be configured to be that of an informal, supportive "friendly coach".

### 3.8. User Feedback
- `REQ-26`: Each question during a training session will have a mechanism (e.g., a flag icon) for the user to report an error.
- `REQ-27`: Error reports will be saved to the database (Supabase) for manual review by the development team.

## 6. Success Metrics
As a non-commercial hobby project, the MVP's success will be measured by qualitative feedback and basic engagement rather than traditional business KPIs. The original, more complex criteria (e.g., completion rates) are formally deferred post-MVP.

- Primary Goal: Launch a functional, stable MVP version of the TenseAI application. This is a binary metric (achieved/not achieved).
- Qualitative Goal: Gather positive and constructive feedback from an initial group of at least 10 test users. Success is defined as at least 7 out of 10 testers providing positive feedback on the quality of exercises and AI-generated feedback.
- Quantitative Metric: Track the total number of completed training sessions across all users. This will serve as a general indicator of user engagement.
  - Measurement: This will be implemented by creating a new record in the `sessions` table in the database for each fully completed session (i.e., all 3 rounds finished), linked to the `user_id`. This allows for simple counting and potential future analysis.
