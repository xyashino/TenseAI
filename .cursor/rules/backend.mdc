### Backend and Database

- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions.
- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance.
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend.
- Use supabase from context.locals in Astro routes instead of importing supabaseClient directly
- Use SupabaseClient type from `src/db/supabase.client.ts`, not from `@supabase/supabase-js`
- Use `@` imports instead of relative paths

### Backend Code Organization

- **ALL backend-only code MUST be placed in `src/server/`** directory
- `src/server/` is server-only - code here will NEVER be bundled for the client
- Structure within `src/server/`:
  - `services/` - Business logic and data access layer (e.g., `ProfileService`)
  - `utils/` - Backend utilities (e.g., `auth.ts`, `api-response.ts`, `error-handler.ts`)
  - `validation/` - Zod schemas for request validation
  - `errors/` - Custom error classes for API responses
- `src/shared/` should only contain code that can be safely shared between frontend and backend
- NEVER import from `src/server/` in client components or frontend code
