# Shadcn UI Components

This project uses @shadcn/ui for user interface components. These are beautifully designed, accessible components that can be customized for your application.

## Finding installed components

Components are available in the `src/components/ui` folder, according to the aliases from the `components.json` file

## Using a component

Import the component according to the configured `@/` alias

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Tabs, TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger } from "@/components/ui/tabs"
import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardFooter, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"
```

Example usage of components:

```tsx
<Button variant="outline">Click me</Button>

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Card Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Card Description</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <p>Card Content</p>
  </CardContent>
  <CardFooter>
    <p>Card Footer</p>
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

## Installing additional components

Many other components are available, but they are not currently installed. The full list can be found at https://ui.shadcn.com/r

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
