### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TenseAI.git
   cd TenseAI
   ```

2. **Set the correct Node version**

- ✅ 4 grammar tenses: Present Simple, Past Simple, Present Perfect, Future Simple
- ✅ Multiple-choice question training mode
- ✅ Two difficulty levels: Basic (A2/B1) and Advanced (B2)
- ✅ AI-generated questions and feedback
- ✅ Manually created theory content in Markdown
- ✅ History of completed sessions with detailed summaries
- ✅ Session pause and resume functionality
- ✅ User-facing mechanism for reporting question errors

### Out of Scope for MVP

- ❌ Additional training modes (fill-in-the-blanks, sentence construction)
- ❌ Gamification elements (points, streaks, badges, leaderboards)
- ❌ Spaced repetition system for reviewing questions
- ❌ Coverage of all English grammar tenses
- ❌ More granular difficulty levels
- ❌ Social features (friend lists, sharing results)

- ❌ Advanced user statistics or progress charts
- ❌ Monetization features (subscriptions, ads, in-app purchases)

## Project Status

**Current Version**: 0.0.1 (MVP Development Phase)

TenseAI is currently in active development. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is being built to validate the core concept: AI-driven practice can significantly improve grammar acquisition for English language learners.

### Success Metrics

- **Primary Goal**: Launch a functional, stable MVP version
- **Qualitative Goal**: Gather feedback from at least 10 test users with 70% positive reception
- **Quantitative Metric**: Track total number of completed training sessions across all users
